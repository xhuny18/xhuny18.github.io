	  <p style="color: #FFFFFF; font-size: large; text-align: justify; font-family: Gotham, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">Studio Ghibli, Inc. is a Japanese animation film studio based in Koganei, Tokyo, Japan. The studio is best known for its anime feature films, and has also produced several short films, television commercials, and one television film. It was founded on June 15, 1985, after the success of Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind (1984), with funding by Tokuma Shoten.
	    Eight of Studio Ghibli's films are among the 15 highest-grossing anime films made in Japan, with Spirited Away (2001) being the second highest, grossing over US$290 million worldwide. Many of their works have won the Animage Anime Grand Prix award, and four have won the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year. Five of Studio Ghibli's films received Academy Award nominations in the United States. Spirited Away won a Golden Bear in 2002 and an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film in 2003. Totoro, a character from My Neighbor Totoro, is the studio's mascot.
	    On August 3, 2014, Studio Ghibli announced it was temporarily halting production following the retirement of director Hayao Miyazaki, who co-founded the studio with Isao Takahata. 
	    In February 2017, Toshio Suzuki announced that Hayao Miyazaki has come out of retirement to direct a new feature film with Studio Ghibli.

	  <p style="color: #FFFFFF; font-size: large; text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: justify">If you have ever seen a movie made by this film studio you should know that those movies have great quality and more important an interesting and great story, each of them need a lot of time and creativity to do them; Hayao Miyazaki, the director is the one that makes it possible. I hope that his last movie would be, like the others, a great movie</span>.</p>
